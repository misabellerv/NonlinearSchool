## ðŸ¥‘: About the project
This project was carried out for the School on Nonlinear Dynamics, Complex Networks, Information Theory and Machine Learning in Neuroscience. In it we explore a computational simulation of a mathematical model for possible synchronization between neurons. We varied parameters of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the noise applied to the system. With that we make a study of possible thresholds for synchronization.

## ðŸ’»: Functionalities
Simulation of chain behavior of neuron spikes using the reference [1].
You can change main parameters and view different synchronization thresholds.

## :wrench: :Tecnologies
* Python;
* Matlab;

## :rocket: : Running the project
You can clone it, and then choose if you want to try the experimental part (.ipynb), or run the main code (.py) to see the results straightforward.
The folders are divided into codes and presentation. Check the codes to analyze the results and run by yourself. Check the presentation to see our slides.
